# Maker Vaults

Maker Vaults are a core component of the Maker Protocol which facilitate the generation of Dai against locked up collateral.

Vault usage alters the total supply of Dai. Users create Dai by generating it against their collateral and destroy Dai when repaying their generated Dai balance. This process happens on-chain, which enables full auditability of circulating Dai and the collateral backing it.

Vaults are required to be overcollateralized and have a Liquidation Ratio that Vault owners must maintain to avoid the liquidation of their collateral. This process protects Dai's backing from decreasing value of volatile collateral. 

Additionally, a debt ceiling is imposed on each Vault type to prevent over-reliance on risky or illiquid collaterals.

Any user who wishes to generate Dai will pay a Stability Fee on the generated Dai balance. These fees are used to manage the Dai peg, fund development and maintenance of the Maker Protocol and reward governors of the Maker Protocol.

## Why Open a Vault?

Vaults let users access the underlying value of their assets while avoiding the need to sell them.

**Leverage**

Speculators can “leverage” collateral in a decentralized manner to increase exposure to a given asset by investing Dai generated from their Vault. Users seeking leverage should proceed with caution as it magnifies the risk of loss as well as the potential for gains.

**Draw Liquidity from Your Assets**

Users looking for liquidity can turn to Vaults since Dai can serve any purpose. Some examples generate Dai off of their cryptocurrency assets to purchase automobiles, pay college tuition, or cover home renovations.

**Flexible Repayment Schedule**

Vaults offer flexible terms. There are no repayment schedules, no minimum payments, and no credit history requirements. Users can repay at their own pace as long as their Vault is properly collateralized.

Any use case of Vaults is associated with various risks. Every user should have a good understanding of risks applicable in their situation. These risks are **not** covered in these documents.
